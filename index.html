            Elephants are the largest land animals, known for their
            intelligence, strong social bonds, and remarkable memory. Native to
            Africa and Asia, they use their versatile trunks for various tasks.
            Despite their strength, elephants face threats like habitat loss and
            poaching, making conservation efforts vital for their survival.
